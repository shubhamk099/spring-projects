/**
 * When a prototype bean is injected into a singleton bean, Spring only creates
 * and injects the prototype once â€” at the time the singleton is created. After
 * that, the singleton bean holds that same instance permanently.
 * 
 * So:
 * 
 * The VehicleService instance is created once when the Vehicle bean is created.
 * 
 * Even though VehicleService is prototype-scoped, Spring injects only one
 * instance into Vehicle.
 * 
 * As a result, vehicleService acts like a singleton inside Vehicle.
